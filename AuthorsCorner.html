                            <p>"Three from the Forest" is a series of books by Yuri Nikitin about the adventures of three neuroses, exiled from their tribe, living in the deep forest, to the big world. The first published book of the series ("Three from the Forest") was also the first book written in the genre of the heroic direction of Russian fantasy[1]. The cycle illustrates the development of humanity from "ancient times" to the present day, raising questions of predestination, the search for "truth for all", building a world based on justice, the development of world religions and the role of technological progress in society. The author offers the concept of changing the perception of the world by mankind as it matures - yes, at first it is a flat world resting on a turtle, by the end of the cycle - peace in the modern scientific representation.</p>

                            <p>The novel "Sheriff" is a book in the popular genre of LitRPG today. With a very important difference from analogues: there is irony over the genre itself, there is an element of parody of works in this genre. The main character of the novel is Jonathan Lawrence, whose spaceship broke down and got stuck on an asteroid. Will the rescuers wait a long time, and will they arrive at all? Jonathan concludes a contract with the company that created the most popular online game and immerses himself in virtuality. But, having found himself in the game world and becoming the sheriff of the city, the hero does not change his principles. Even in the game, even "accidentally", he refuses to "die", despite the guaranteed immortality of his character, he does not engage in his "pumping" and collection of artifacts at all, but continues to behave in the same way as in real life. At the same time, he quickly achieves what others take years to achieve. It is not surprising that over time, Jonathan attracts the close attention of the entire virtual world. How will this story end and is it possible to survive in the game while remaining a person with firm moral values and an open soul?</p>
